# Airbyte

Some streams can be retrieved via Airbyte custom connector builder, as they do not overload the API.

To deploy Airbyte on a Minikube Cluster, you can use their Helm chart and [this documentation](https://docs.airbyte.com/deploying-airbyte/) 

You can directly import the connector.yaml file into Airbyte and use the source.
